# Gulp samples files

Some gulp configurations for different projects. 

There is one configuration by branch.

Branch description : 
* **master** : Drupal. 
  SaSS, livereload on twig
* **drupal-8** : SaSS, livereload on twig

## How it works 

clone the only branch needed
```
git clone -b <branch> https://github.com/PublicVar/gulp-samples.git
```
